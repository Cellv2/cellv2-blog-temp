My first blog post.

I really want to get a blog stood up nicely, but will do that on the side when time permits.

I plan on using Gatsby for my permanent blog when it happens, so I've set up this small blog for the moment and will rock and roll from there. Just going to be a simple copy pasta job with the MD files I hope!
